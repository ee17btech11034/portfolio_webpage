# My Portfolio with help of AI

A modular, dual-layout portfolio featuring a visual logic to represent professional growth through dynamic animations.

## 🚀 The Concept
The portfolio is split into two primary zones:
- **Left Sidebar:** internally scrollable area for Profile details, Socials, Technical Arsenal, and Awards.
- **Right Timeline:** A vertical journey of experiences and projects.

## Current Progress
Phase 1: Basic Layout
Commit 1: Create the basic dual-pane structure. A fixed sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right with a dark-themed aesthetic.
Commit 2: adding the profile image, social links, web links.

Phase 2: Technical Content 
Commit 3: Adding skills and Awards
Commit 4: Move links to parallel to profile. And Create seperate CSS files for these as it is getting confusing.
        We are using sections instead of di for better readability.
