# My Portfolio with help of AI

A modular, dual-layout portfolio featuring a visual logic to represent professional growth through dynamic animations.

## 🚀 The Concept
The portfolio is split into two primary zones:
- **Left Sidebar:** A fixed, internally scrollable area for Profile details, Socials, Technical Arsenal, and Awards.
- **Right Timeline:** A vertical journey of experiences and projects.

## Current Progress
 Phase 1:
Create the basic dual-pane structure. A fixed sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right with a dark-themed aesthetic.

Here I will add the details we have added to this portfolio:
- To divide this in 2 parts we need `aside`. 
- Left Side:
-- Using aside for left side as it works best for Sidebars, call-out boxes, or "extra" info.
-- Add a profile picture


- Right Side:
-- Using "main" tag for Experiences, it is best as it is main content and people can directly go to this
